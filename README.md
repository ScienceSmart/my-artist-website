# My Artist Webiste

**As of 05/28/2025, this project is not complete so it should not be used unless stated 'completed'**

Many artist or creators have their own webiste to display their portfolio, and most of the time, they use pre-existing services such as WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, etc since they are not programmers in their field. 

However, one can use this project for getting a basic layout while adding their content and just pay for the hosting of the website instead. If they have a computer science background, then they can modify the code as they wish. 

I created the project using NextJS for indexing on Google and Tailwind CSS due to its simplicity. There is also creating your own account to act as a Content Management System (CMS) in updating the website.
